The assignment of the oop345 course is the final project that conclude all the subject I have taught during this course. 
It unites almost every topic in a sophisticated and beautiful structured application. The fact that all modules finally work with each
 other seems like something unreal, because just imagine that all those functions, variables and inheritances could be connected this way 
was almost impossible in the beginning of this assignment. The main challenge I faced was with the milestone 3 because it requires to use 
advanced level of c++ language and connect correctly all created variables and method in one program. Especially was hard to understand the 
requirements for this milestone because the wording sometimes is very confusing and some parts that have to be included in code to work are 
missing in description. But overall, it was very interesting to be able to challenge myself with this assignment.
